<p>I have had my ham radio license (WÃ˜PGK) for 13 years, and have always had a mobile station installed on my vehicles.  Over the years, I have upgraded both my vehicles and my radio equiptment.  Today I am driving a 2008 Jeep JK Rubicon and running a Kenwood TM-D700.  I really donâ€™t have a step by step here, but I can post what I have done, with photos so you can get an idea on how to install it on your own Jeep.</p>

<p>To start with, I will show you the center console.  You can see that I ran an external speaker up here since the unit speaker is under the seat.</p>

<p>I placed the ham radio mic to the left, which is still easy to reach</p>

<p>I extended the mic cable with a RJ45 connector</p>

<p>I located the the radio base unit under the passenger seat.  I would like to change this in the furture as this has no water proofing if I ever get into water deep enough to reach this.</p>

<p>As for power source, I have one lead connected to the battery.</p>

<p>I run that power lead through the firewall through a well know access hole next to the door</p>

<p>The power is connected to a Automatic power switch that power everything down 10 minutes after the engine has been shut off.</p>

<p>The power is then routed to a distribution block which connects the GPS, phone changer, CB radio and ham radio.</p>

<p>As for the mentioned GPS, I have it up on top of one of the A pillers tucked away and out of sight.</p>

<p>Note, that everything uses Power Poles which makes connecting power lead extremelly easy.  These are not required, but recommmend.</p>
