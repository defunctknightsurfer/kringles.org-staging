I"d<p>I have been wanting to do this for a while, and finally got around to it.  I have uploaded 2009, 2010, 2011, and 2012 Moab Videos to my <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/pkringle/">YouTube Channel</a>. Sadly, 2015 will not happen this year, but we are planning on 2016 trip.  2016 should be epic as we have some surprises planned for that year!</p>
