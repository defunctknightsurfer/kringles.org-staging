I"¨<p>In a virutal enviorment I have found that I still like a lot of the features of zfs, but I do not end the RAID functionaily.  With that I had the need to expand a single disk zpool due to space issues.  In the past, we simply just added a second disk creating a RAID 0.  But I knew there was a better way.  ZFS on Linux does support resizing or autoexpand on a single disk zpool.  To do this, do the following steps.</p>
