I went out and bought an Axial SXC-10 Jeep kit.  For the last 2 weeks I have been working on Jeep kit, with the goal to be, make the Jeep look as much like my real Jeep as possible.

I a few days ago I completed assembled the frame, axles and transmission.

I am currently working on painting the body and installing the electronics.  Expect to see more updates soon.
