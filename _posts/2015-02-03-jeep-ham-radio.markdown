I have had my ham radio license (WÃ˜PGK) for 13 years, and have always had a mobile station installed on my vehicles.  Over the years, I have upgraded both my vehicles and my radio equiptment.  Today I am driving a 2008 Jeep JK Rubicon and running a Kenwood TM-D700.  I really don't have a step by step here, but I can post what I have done, with photos so you can get an idea on how to install it on your own Jeep.
